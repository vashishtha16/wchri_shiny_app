The goal of Schroth exercises is to teach patients to consciously maintain the correct posture in daily living activities in order to improve the curve, pain, and self-image. To achieve this goal, Schroth exercises focus on endurance and strength training of postural muscles. Schroth exercises also aim to improve posture motor control by repeating corrective movements with progressively less feedback and less passive support.

In addition, patients are required to come weekly for 1-hour long group sessions over the span of 6 months.",Other,Global Postural Re-Education,"The 6-month supervised Global Postural Re-education intervention involves active movements and postures aimed at realigning joints, stretching shortened muscles and enhancing the contraction of antagonist muscles, thus avoiding postural asymmetry. These postures imply an active participation of the patient. Global Postural Re-education includes eight therapeutic postures, lying, sitting or standing, held for 15/20 min. each. Variously combinations are used during sessions chosen on based on the amount of pain, load capacity, age of the patient, and muscle chains to be stretched.

We anticipate greater than 80% completion rate based on published data and because the pilot dropout rate was less than 10%.   A unilateral hypothesis is justified by positive published data and our pilot data. The pilot effect size for the Cobb angle was 0.32 and many secondary outcomes had effect sizes exceeding what we are powered to detect as significant. We believe that a 0.32 effect size is clinically important, feasible, and would justify implementing a Schroth program. The trial duration is relatively short which justifies aiming to detect a small effect size (0.2-0.5)132. It would be inadequate to power the trial to detect too small an effect size as patients and families will likely demand evidence of clinically important effects before committing efforts and time required of Schroth exercise programs.","Data is collected at baseline, and at 3 month, 6 month, 9 month and 12 month assessments.

The treating physician informed patients of the trial at the time a clinical decision was made to treat migraine with an intravenous medication. Patients and parents who gave verbal consent were informed and screened by the research coordinator. Those patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria, who assented to the study, and whose parents signed consent, were enrolled and randomized to one of two groups: (1) Intravenous metoclopramide with intravenous placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) and (2) Intravenous metoclopramide with intravenous ketorolac. Patient randomization was supported by a web-based randomization system. Patients were allocated using permuted block randomization with variable block sizes at each site. The target number of study participants was 50; the actual number of study participants was 56.    Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcome and a two-sided, two-sample t-test for the comparison of group means using PASS analysis software. A sample size of 25 per group achieves 90% power to detect a difference between group means of about 2 cm (1.96 cm), assuming the standard deviation (SD) is 2.1 cm in each group and a two-sided Type I Error of 0.05.",Outcome assessments were performed every 30 minutes for a total of 2 hours during the active treatment phase from the initiation of the intravenous infusion.

An additional 16 participants will be recruited to accommodate an estimated 10 % drop out rate (144/.9) for a total of 160. The 10 % drop out rate was based on the current 7 % drop out rate in the feasibility trial conducted at Holland Bloorview. Sample size calculations were based on pre- to post-intervention change on the primary outcome (Gross Motor Function Measure-66) (GMFM-66) and a two-factor factorial design (F tests). PASS software was used to calculate sample size.   Qualitative: Target sample size: 18 RCT participant child-parent dyads (6 dyads from each site) and 3 parents from each site who declined participation in the RCT.
