# wchri_shiny_app
A shiny based app to access metadata related to WCHRI researchers. This app facilitates the access to the catalogue developed by University of Alberta Libraries for the studies related to the WCHRI researcher. User can easily access the metadata related to the desired study by a selected WCHRI researcher at desired web platform. The choices provided by this tool consist of: Clinicaltrials.gov (only for clinical trials), Dataverse and RedCap.
The description of files: The App is coded into two files namely, "server.R" and "ui.R". Most of the csv files were used in the backend for the smooth access to the metadata related to the selected studies. 
The program "ClinTrialMetadataDownload.R" is used inside the "server.R" to download the metadata from clinicaltrials.gov.
The image files "uamyaccount.png" and "wchrilogo.jpg" should be stored in a folder named "www" inside the master folder of the app.
